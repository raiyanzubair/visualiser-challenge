- Clone this repo.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` or `node index` to start it.
- It will go through each blog post from `https://www.propelleraero.com/blog` and display the title and number of words in the blog post to the command line. (This may take a little while)
- Once it is done it will output the blog post with the most words to the command line. 
- If any errors occur or it freezes or times out, try re-running it. It should work eventually :)
